1. The characteristics of Big data:

	* Volume-The amount of data generated and stored.The size of the data is an important factor and determines the value and hence can be 
	                considered as a big data or not

	* Variety-This deals with the variety of data.

	* Velocity-	This deals with the speed at which data id generated and  processed.

	* Variablility-This deals with the inconsistency of data that hamper processes to handle and manage it

	*Varacity-This deals with the quality of the data that is captured.

2.  The possible solutions to handle Big data:

	1. Scale Up :
		Increase the configurations of the individual system like disk capacity,RAM capacity, etc.
	2.Scale Out:
		Use multiple commodity hardwares and there by distributing the load in regards with storage or processing.
		Hence making it economical and efficient.

3. The differences between scaling up and scaling out:

	Scaling up:Scaling up  refers to the purchasing and installing better hardwares there by 
		increasing the capacity and performances.
	Scaling down: scaling out refers to the process of linking together various lower-performance
		     machines to collectively do the work of an advanced system as a single device.
